# NestJS Assignment – User & Document Management API

A production-grade backend system built using **NestJS**, **PostgreSQL**, and **Sequelize**.  
This project demonstrates a scalable and modular architecture with authentication, role-permission RBAC, document management, ingestion workflows, testing, and Docker deployment.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Modular architecture with SOLID principles
- JWT-based authentication
- Role-based access with dynamic permission checks
- Document upload with file type storage
- Ingestion trigger API with job tracking
- Sequelize migrations & seeders
- Centralized logging (Winston), validation, and response interceptor
- Swagger API documentation
- Unit and e2e tests with Jest (≥70% coverage)
- Dockerized setup with Docker Compose support

---

## 🧪 Local Development

### Prerequisites

- Node.js v18+
- PostgreSQL running locally
- npm or yarn

### Setup Instructions

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
npm install

# 2. Create your environment config
cp .env.example .env

# 3. Run DB migrations
npm run migrate

# 4. Run DB seeders
npm run seed

# 5. Start the app in dev mode
npm run start:dev
```

App will be accessible at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)  
Swagger docs at [http://localhost:3000/api/docs](http://localhost:3000/api/docs)

---

## 🐳 Docker & Deployment

### Prerequisites

- Docker
- Docker Compose

---

### 🔧 Docker Standalone (Manual)

```bash
# Build the Docker image
docker build -t nestjs-assignment .

# Run the app (requires .env file)
docker run -p 3000:3000 --env-file .env nestjs-assignment
```

---

### 🚀 Docker Compose (Recommended)

```bash
# Launch PostgreSQL + NestJS app together
docker-compose up --build
```

This will:
- Start a Postgres database
- Build and run the NestJS app
- Run DB migrations and seeders automatically
- Expose the API on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

To stop:

```bash
docker-compose down           # stop only
docker-compose down -v        # stop and remove volumes
```

---

## ⚙️ Environment Variables

Use the provided `.env.example` as a template. Example config:

```env
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
DB_USERNAME=postgres
DB_PASSWORD=postgres
DB_NAME=nestjs_assignment

JWT_SECRET=your-secret
```

These are injected automatically in Docker via `environment:` block.

---

## 🧪 Testing

```bash
# Run all unit and e2e tests
npm run test

# Run tests with coverage (threshold: ≥70%)
npm run test:cov
```

---

## 📚 Swagger API Docs

After startup, visit:

```
http://localhost:3000/api/docs
```

Includes full documentation for:
- Authentication
- User CRUD
- Role & permission setup
- Document upload
- Ingestion trigger

---

## 🌐 Production Notes

- Uses multi-stage Dockerfile (`node:18-alpine`) for optimal image size
- Runs app in `start:prod` mode with compiled JS from `dist/`
- DB bootstrap (migrations + seeders) happens at container start
- Cloud-ready: can deploy to AWS EC2, ECS, GCP, Azure, or Render with `.env` injection

_You may extend with NGINX reverse proxy and HTTPS in a real deployment._

---

## 🧱 Sequelize CLI Usage

```bash
# Generate new migration
npx sequelize-cli migration:generate --name add_table_name

# Run all migrations
npm run migrate

# Run all seeders
npm run seed
```

## 🔄 CI/CD Pipeline (Phase 9)

This project uses **GitHub Actions** for CI/CD automation.

### ✅ Pipeline Overview

Located at `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, the workflow does:

1. Checkout code and install dependencies
2. Run tests and check code coverage
3. Build production-ready app
4. Build Docker image
5. Optionally push image to DockerHub or deploy

### 🧪 Sample CI Workflow

```yaml
name: CI Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  build-and-test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    services:
      postgres:
        image: postgres:15
        env:
          POSTGRES_DB: nestjs_assignment
          POSTGRES_USER: postgres
          POSTGRES_PASSWORD: postgres
        ports: ['5432:5432']
        options: >-
          --health-cmd pg_isready
          --health-interval 10s
          --health-timeout 5s
          --health-retries 5

    env:
      DB_HOST: localhost
      DB_PORT: 5432
      DB_USERNAME: postgres
      DB_PASSWORD: postgres
      DB_NAME: nestjs_assignment
      JWT_SECRET: test_secret

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Use Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: 18

      - run: npm install

      - name: Run Migrations
        run: npm run migrate

      - name: Run Seeders
        run: npm run seed

      - name: Run Tests
        run: npm run test:cov

      - name: Build App
        run: npm run build

      - name: Docker Build (optional)
        run: docker build -t nestjs-assignment .
```

### 🔠 Optional: DockerHub Push

To enable DockerHub image push:

- Add `DOCKER_USERNAME` and `DOCKER_PASSWORD` to repo secrets
- Append this to workflow:

```yaml
- name: Login to DockerHub
  run: echo "${{ secrets.DOCKER_PASSWORD }}" | docker login -u "${{ secrets.DOCKER_USERNAME }}" --password-stdin

- name: Push Image
  run: |
    docker tag nestjs-assignment ${{ secrets.DOCKER_USERNAME }}/nestjs-assignment:latest
    docker push ${{ secrets.DOCKER_USERNAME }}/nestjs-assignment:latest
```

## 📘 Final Documentation Summary (Phase 10)

### 🔹 Project Intent
This backend system is designed to demonstrate modular, scalable backend development in NestJS using production-grade practices.

### 🔹 Design Decisions
- Used Sequelize instead of TypeORM or Prisma for direct control and SQL-first design
- Soft deletes and timestamps used across entities
- RBAC handled via 1:1 user-role and M:N role-permission, enforced with decorators and guards
- Used `shared/env.ts` for centralized env management and `Winston` logger for centralized logging

### 🔹 Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for each module using mocked dependencies
- Single E2E test for Auth (with JWT validation)
- Jest configured with minimum 70% coverage enforcement

### 🔹 Deployment Readiness
- Dockerfile and Compose provided
- `.env.example` included for ease of setup
- GitHub Actions pipeline to build/test/deploy

### 🔹 Known Limitations (Intentionally Skipped for Assignment Scope)

These features were left out intentionally to focus on assignment completeness and avoid over-engineering:

- ❌ Redis sessions for stateless token storage (JWT only used)
- ❌ Storing permissions inside JWT for faster auth (used DB lookups instead)
- ❌ Additional E2E tests for non-auth modules (Auth E2E only covered)
- ❌ PM2 process manager and NGINX reverse proxy (good for real prod)
- ❌ Jenkins or GitLab CI support (GitHub Actions used)
- ❌ Winston daily rotate logs (kept minimal Winston config for assignment)

Each of these can be easily added with minimal effort in a real-world production extension.
